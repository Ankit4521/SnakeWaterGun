Snake Water Gun game in Python
This is a one player game that can be played with the computer when you feel bored .  It is a modified version of Rock,Paper,Scissor. Let me explain this game to you :
There are 3 main elements 
1. Snake : A snake can drink all the water but fails to do anything against the gun's bullet and dies . So if you opt for Snake and you opponent chooses
          water you will win but if your opponent chooses gun you lose.
2. Water : Water faaects the gun and stops it from functioning but is helpless against snake who drinks it all. So if ypou choose water and your opponent opt for gun you win
          but if your opponent chooses snake you loose
3. Gun   : Gun kills the snake but is useless in water . So choosing gun will reward you point against snake but you'll lose against water.
If you and your opponent choose the same element then it is a tie.
